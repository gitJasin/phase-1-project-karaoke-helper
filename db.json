            Is this just fantasy?

            Open your eyes
            Look up to the skies and see
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
            Because I'm easy come, easy go
            Little high, little low
            Any way the wind blows
            Doesn't really matter to me, to me
            
            Mama, just killed a man
            Put a gun against his head
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
            Mama, life had just begun
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away
            
            Mama, ooh
            Didn't mean to make you cry
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
            Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

            Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

            I don't wanna die
            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
            
            I see a little silhouetto of a man
            Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
            Thunderbolt and lightning very, very frightening me

            I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
            He's just a poor boy from a poor family
            Spare him his life from this monstrosity
