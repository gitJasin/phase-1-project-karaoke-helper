# Welcome to Karaoke Helper!

##### This is my phase-1 project for software development bootcamp at Flatiron School 2023. It is creating a Karaoke Helper. Below is a description of:
- Context of the Work - general vision
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Requirements, 
- User Stories 
- Dream Features

## Context of the work

There is a live band karaoke that my friends and I frequent. They have a few printed books of the songs, sorted by artist, that you can choose from. My goal is to digitize this catalog of music and add cool features that can help enhance the rad karaoke experience. 

## MVP Requirements - Phase-1-Project requiremnts

- Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server. Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. APIs that are free and require no authorization will be easiest to use. For ideas, see this list of no-auth APIs. If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to github!

- Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects or reloads. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

- Use at least 2 distinct event listeners (2 events of different types) that enable interactivity. What this means is that, if you had 2 click events, that would only count as 1 distinct event and you would need to add at least 1 more. Think search or filter functionality, toggling dark/light mode, upvoting posts, etc. Each of your event listeners should also have its own unique callback function. These must be added using JavaScript's .addEventListener() method. Events embedded into HTML elements and CSS will not count toward the total. Please ask your instructor if you have questions regarding this requirement.
Your project must implement at least one instance of array iteration using available array methods (map, forEach, filter, etc). Manipulating your API data in some way should present an opportunity to implement your array iteration.

- Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

### Stretch goals

- Use json-server in your project to persist your app's interactivity.

- Use 3 or more event listeners.

## User Stories

- User will be able to find a song via song scroller. Each song card in the scroller allows the user to click band and song like buttons, add song to sing queue, and click on more info

- User will be able to select the song and see the lyrics and a youtube video of the song

- User will be able to add the song they want to sing to a song queue 

- User can delete songs from the song queue 

- User can like a song and/or artist and see how many likes an artist and or song has

- User can see top 3 artists and songs

## Dream Features

- Digitize entrire catalogue 

- Make it social  

- User can see a list of the top 3 most popular songs and artists - DONE

- User can request song./ artist to be added to the catalog - KINDA DONE

- MC of the Karaoke can control the song queue rather than user

- User can get a text message when they are next in the queue to sing 

- Integrate an API to pull more items like, artist image, genre, etc to allow for more ways to find a song to sing

- Unsure what to sing, or want to challenge yourself? Click the random song button!
